[0mI am a software developer, with a bachelor CS and a minor 
economics. I'm a fullstack devleoper, with a ton of experience 
creating rich user experiences and in the development and use 
of component frameworks.

I currently reside in Vancouver BC, Canada. I am fortunate to 
hold multiple citizenships which allow me to work in 
Canada, the United States and throughout Europe.

I am an active member, and for a time, was Vice President of 
Greater Vancouver Interactive Arts Society (GVIAS), a 
not-for-profit  society created to promote community-based 
interactive arts in Greater Vancouver and British Columbia. 
GVIAS's mission is to encourage interactive and participatory 
experiences in the spirit of the 10 principles of Burning Man. 
I now assist in facilitating technology needs surrounding 
GVIAS and GVIAS's flagship festival 
event, host to 1600 participants.
